# Mercury
The first and only SMS based medical info center
Mercury works to service the population of the world that has access to mobile services but not a reliable internet connection. The Goal of Mercury is to use SMS to deliver a convenient medical search app to anyone in the world even without the luxury of an internet connection. Using APIs such as Twilio, Endlessmedicine, and BeautifulSoup, Mercury uses a Python Flask Backend server to process the incoming SMS data and scan the web using a BeautifulSoup web scrapper. This info is then summarized using a Natural Language Processing import and returns concise information on possible conditions faced by the user.
